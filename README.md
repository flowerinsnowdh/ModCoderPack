The **Mod Coder Pack** (Formerly Minecraft Coder Pack) is a collection of scripts and tools to help developers create mods for both the [Java Edition](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition) [server](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server) and [client](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Client).

# Description
The package was created to help mod creators to decompile, change and recompile the [Minecraft](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft) [classes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Classes). Instructions are included in the readme files which come with the package. The package contains scripts to decompile, recompile, and reobfuscate the game and the [server](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server).
